## Project Overview

Impossible Burger is looking for proteins to provide beef flavor for plant-based burgers, and the scientist working on this project believes these proteins may come from the human body, specifically the naval.  The purpose of this project is to plot the results of testing naval bacteria to see which bacteria are present and in what quantities.  We also added demographic information for each volunteer who provided samples from their navals as well as the number of times they wash their navals weekly.  The information displayed on the page shows the results from samples provided by volunteers, and selecting an ID from the dropdown menu pulls up the data specifically for that data.
